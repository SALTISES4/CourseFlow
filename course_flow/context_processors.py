CONTEXT PROCESSORS

Context processors in Django are functions that add specific
data to the context of every template across a project.
They help in making information like user details and settings
globally available to all templates.

Context processors are configured in the TEMPLATES settings.
where they are added to the context_processors list.

They should be used  judiciously due to potential performance impacts,
as they execute  for every template rendered.
